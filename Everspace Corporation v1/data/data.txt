	description `The ancestral home world of humanity, Earth has a population ten times that of any other inhabited planet. Sprawling cities cover large portions of its surface, many of them overcrowded and dangerous. Some people work to scrape together enough money to leave, while at the same time others, born on distant worlds, make a pilgrimage of sorts to see this planet that once cradled the entirety of the human species.`

As a result, settlements of less than a million are grouped together into planetary districts that elect a single representative between them - a source of much frustration in the frontier worlds.`

	spaceport `	Inside the towers is a warren of dim hallways and dingy shops. Hitchhikers sleep in the corners of unused docking bays under old army blankets, a few uniformed cleaners try to keep the litter and dust in check, and rich tourists from other stars cling tightly to their expensive cameras.`
